## E-Mail

* Secure E-Mail: paul.buetow at protonmail dot com
* E-Mail: paul at buetow dot org (forwards to the ProtonMail address)

Why did I just mention 2 E-Mail addresses here? The buetow.org address will always stay. It is my lifetime E-Mail address as I own the domain name. The address will stay even when I decided to change my email provider.

Use the ProtonMail address if you care about security for now. The address stays valid as long as I am ProtonMail user. Especially if you are ProtonMail user too we could have real E-Mail end-2-end encryption for our conversation.

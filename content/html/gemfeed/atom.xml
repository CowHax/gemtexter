        <summary>Finally, I had time to deploy my own authoritative DNS servers (master and slave) for my domains 'buetow.org' and 'buetow.zone'. My domain name provider is Schlund Technologies. They allow their customers to manually edit the DNS records (BIND files). And they also give you the opportunity to set your own authoritative DNS servers for your domains. From now I am making use of that option.. .....to read on please visit my site.</summary>

        <summary>I enhanced the procedure a bit. From now on I am having two external 2TB USB hard drives. Both are setup exactly the same way. To decrease the probability that they will not fail at about the same time both drives are of different brands. One drive is kept at the secret location. The other one is kept at home right next to my HP MicroServer. ...to read on visit my site.</summary>

        <summary>Fype is an interpreted programming language created by me for learning and fun. The interpreter is written in C. It has been tested on FreeBSD and NetBSD and may also work on other Unix like operating systems such as Linux based ones.
